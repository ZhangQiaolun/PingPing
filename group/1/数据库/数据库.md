activity_describe = "go swimming together！ have fun!Competitive swimming became popular in the 19th century. The goal of 
competitive swimming is to break personal or world records while beating competitors in any given event. Swimming in competition 
should create the least resistance in order to obtain maximum speed. However, some professional swimmers who do not hold a national
or world ranking are considered the best in regard to their technical skills. Typically, an athlete goes through a cycle of training
in which the body is overloaded with work in the beginning and middle segments of the cycle, and then the workload is decreased in 
the final stage as the swimmer approaches competition."
